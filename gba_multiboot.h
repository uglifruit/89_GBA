// gba_multiboot.h — GBA BIOS Multiboot uploader (RP2040 as master).
//
// Implements the single-game-pak / download-play multiboot protocol: sync with a
// cartridge-less GBA, stream a compiled multiboot ROM (linked for EWRAM @ 0x02000000)
// into it, and verify with the final CRC handshake. The GBA BIOS then runs the payload.
//
// Protocol + magic constants transcribed from the canonical open references
// (akkera102/gba_01_multiboot and the RP2040 port in copyrat90/gba-pico-gamepad), which
// agree exactly. The obfuscation constants (0x6f646573, 0x43202f2f, 0xc37b, 0xc387) are a
// fixed, publicly documented part of the BIOS handshake, not secrets.

// It once tested the MISO pad for a low level, based on an observation made while the pad
// inversion was set the other way round. When the polarity was corrected the test inverted
// its meaning, always timed out, and callers that gated on it stopped attempting multiboot
// entirely. The protocol's own bounded sync loop inside gba_multiboot_send() is the correct
// readiness test: it is polarity-independent and returns NoGBA promptly when nothing answers.
