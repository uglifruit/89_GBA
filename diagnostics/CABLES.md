# Link cables and continuity checks (89_GBA)

Bench reference. **Do every check with everything powered off**, before a console is
connected to the Workshop Computer. Write your findings in the blank column — wire colours
are not standardised, not even between official Nintendo production runs, so the table you
fill in for *your* cable is the only trustworthy record.

Related: `TESTPLAN.md` (**the current bench procedure — start there**), `BRINGUP.md` (the
accumulated background), and the pin map in `../gba_spi.h`.

## The GBA link socket

Six pins in two rows of three: **odd 1/3/5 on one row, even 2/4/6 on the other**. The shell
is a hexagon with an asymmetric **lump/key** — not a trapezoid. Pins **1 and 2 sit at the lump
end**. The numbering MIRRORS between the plug and the socket, which is the single easiest
thing to get wrong:

```
      PLUG (contacts toward you)          SOCKET (looking into the GBA)
    ┌──────────────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────────────┐
    │    1    3    5           │      │           5    3    1    │
    │        ╱▔▔▔╲             │      │            ╱▔▔▔╲         │
    │    2    4    6           │      │           6    4    2    │
    └──────────────────────────┘      └──────────────────────────┘
         lump at the 1/2 end               lump mirrors too
```

Anchor on the **lump**, never on "left" or "right" — it is the one feature that survives the
connector being held either way up. All directions below are **from the GBA's point of view**
while it is a multiboot slave (which is the only role we drive it in).

| Pin | Name | Dir | Connects to | Workshop GPIO |
|-----|------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | VCC +3.3V | out | **nothing — tape it off** | — |
| 2 | SO | **out** | Pulse In 1 | GPIO 2 |
| 3 | SI | **in** | Pulse Out 2 | GPIO 9 |
| 4 | SD | — | nothing | — |
| 5 | SC | **in** | Pulse Out 1 | GPIO 8 |
| 6 | GND | — | Computer GND | — |

Pins 2/3/5/6 are the only four you need. Pin 1 is a rail the **GBA sources** — it is an
output, not a supply input, and must be left floating. Pin 4 (SD) is unused in normal/SIO32
mode.

Verified against `../gba_spi.h:15-17`, `../main.cpp` and `../gba_spi.pio` — all three agree.

## Which cable is which

### A. Game Boy Color / Game Boy Pocket link cable — **preferred**

**Get one of these rather than a third-party GBA cable.** The connector has been the same
six-pin part since the Game Boy Pocket, so it plugs straight into a GBA — and these cables are
normally **6-core**: every pin in the connector has a wire behind it.

That is the whole reason to prefer one. Third-party GBA cables are wildly inconsistent: many
carry only the three or four conductors that particular cable's intended use needed, and which
three varies between production runs of the same product. **If the conductor you need is simply
absent, no amount of measuring will find it** — and the fault looks exactly like bad wiring.
With six cores you know every signal is there before you start.

It is still a peer-to-peer cable, so **assume SO and SI are swapped between the ends** and
settle it by measurement (`cablecheck.uf2` MODE 0) rather than by reasoning. Buzz each of the
six conductors through to a named pin on the intact plug and fill in the table at the top.

> The original DMG-era cable, with the big chunky connector, will not fit. You want the small
> connector introduced with the Game Boy Pocket.

### B. GameCube → GBA cable (DOL-011)

**Straight-through on the GBA side.** No crossover: the GameCube is unambiguously the
master, so the GBA plug's pins run to the GC plug without a swap. Cut the GameCube end off
and you have an un-swapped breakout of the GBA connector, which removes the crossover question
entirely. Its drawback against a GBC cable is core count: the real DOL-011 has only three
conductors plus a shield (bench notes below), so ground rides the braid and there is no spare if
a conductor is damaged.

Check continuity from each stripped wire to the GBA plug's pins:

| GBA plug pin | Signal | Expect | Your wire colour |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | SO | one wire, continuous | |
| 3 | SI | one wire, continuous | |
| 5 | SC | one wire, continuous | |
| 6 | GND | one wire, continuous | |
| 1 | VCC | **identify and isolate** | |
| 4 | SD | may be absent | |

Then confirm **no wire is shorted to any other** — buzz every pair. A short between SC and
GND, or SI and SO, will look exactly like "the handshake never syncs".

Bench notes on the real DOL-011 (2026-09-03):

- It has **three cores plus a shield**, and only three connected pins at the GameCube end.
  That is correct and sufficient: the fourth connection (GND) rides the **shield/braid**.
  Gather the braid into a pigtail and treat it as a real conductor — it is the ground your
  first session was missing.
- The GameCube end's pin numbering does **not** match GBA pin numbering. Do not infer names
  from it; buzz each conductor through to the **GBA plug's** pins and label by that.

### C. GBA ↔ GBA link cable (AGB-005) — **the crossover trap**

**Pins 2 and 3 are SWAPPED between the two ends.** SO at one end arrives at SI on the other.
It also has a distinguishable "parent" and "child" plug, and you cannot reliably tell them
apart by eye.

If you use this cable, the pin that carries SO *at the end you kept* depends on which end you
kept. So:

1. Buzz pin 2 of your cut end against **both** pin 2 and pin 3 of the intact plug.
2. If your pin 2 → their pin 3, you are holding the crossover side. Your **pin 2 still is
   SO** at your connector — the swap is in the cable, not in the socket. Wire by the **socket
   pin numbers in the table at the top**, always.
3. Record which end you kept, physically label it, and don't mix it up later.

The failure this causes is silent: everything looks wired, and SI/SO are simply transposed,
so the GBA never sees a valid sync word.

### D. Bare/DIY connector or a chopped unknown cable

No assumptions available at all. Buzz all six pins to whatever conductors exist, fill in the
top table, and additionally verify the socket's **physical orientation** — confirm pin 1 by
finding the pin that reads ~3.3V to GND with the GBA powered on and nothing else connected
(this is the one check performed powered, and only with the Workshop side disconnected).

## Before connecting anything to the Workshop Computer

These three are not optional, and two of them are already-diagnosed faults from the last
bench session.

**1. Common ground.** With both units powered, measure DC from Computer GND to GBA GND. It
must read ~0V. Anything else means the grounds are not common and *every other reading you
take is meaningless*. A real GND wire through pin 6 is far better than borrowing the
headphone-jack sleeve.

**2. Series resistors on SC and SI — ~1kΩ each.** The Workshop pulse outputs swing to ~5–6V;
the GBA's inputs are 3.3V logic. The resistor plus the GBA's clamp diode limits the current.
**No resistor on SO** — the GBA drives that at 3.3V into us, which is fine as-is. Note that
using the GameCube cable does *not* fix this; the crossover and the voltage are separate
problems.

**3. Re-measure with the probe running.** SC, SI and SO should all sit within 0–3.3V (SC/SI
measured *after* their series resistors). Nothing should be negative. The last session
measured −2V on SC, which is actively harmful to the console — do not connect a GBA until
that is gone.

## Then

Power the **Computer first, then the GBA** — the GBA only syncs if the master is already
clocking when it powers up. Power-cycle the *GBA*, not the Computer, to retry.

Go to **`TESTPLAN.md`** and work it from STEP 1. It starts with `cablecheck.uf2` MODE 0,
which settles the crossover question by measurement before anything drives the console.
