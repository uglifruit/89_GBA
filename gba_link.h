// gba_link.h — Cross-core shared state + the core-1 GBA link engine.
//
// Core 1 owns the physical link: it runs multiboot, then the post-boot polling loop, streaming
// the module's inputs down and dispatching whatever the GBA sends back. Core 0 (ComputerCard's
// 48 kHz ProcessSample) only ever touches GbaShared — never the SPI.
//
// CONCURRENCY MODEL: every field has a SINGLE WRITER. `volatile` plus word-aligned accesses
// no wider than 32 bits are atomic enough on RP2040 for this, and we never need a consistent
// multi-field snapshot.
//
// The one place that rule was awkward is the gate edge. A "sticky flag set by core 0, cleared
// by core 1" has two writers, and the interleaving that loses a set is exactly the one that
// matters — a trigger arriving as the flag is cleared would vanish. So it is a COUNTER that
// only core 0 ever increments; core 1 keeps its own tally of how many it has reported and
// sends one edge per increment. No update can be lost, and a burst is reported in order.
