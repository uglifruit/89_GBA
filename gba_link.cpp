//
// One 32-bit exchange per poll, mode 3 SPI, RP2040 still the clock master. Downstream is
// almost always a STREAM word carrying the gate plus one of the two input pairs; upstream is
// whatever the GBA had queued, identified by its 16-bit tag. See gba_proto.h.
//
// The tag check is what lets the host reject noise and half-synced words from the slow Pulse
// In 1 line. The tolerance for failures has to be generous: the GBA slave can only have one
// transfer pending and is briefly deaf between finishing one word and re-arming, so a short
// run of tag misses is NORMAL, not a dropped link. An early threshold of 32 at 1 kHz meant
// 32 ms of silence tore the link down and restarted multiboot, which is why it used to connect
// and immediately drop.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ~5 s of unbroken silence at the 1 kHz poll rate before declaring the link dead.

// Multiboot rate LADDER, fastest first.
//
// 100 kHz is the measured, repeatable ceiling (mbrate.uf2, 2026-09-07): it succeeded on every
// power-cycle. 200 kHz was MARGINAL — it sometimes completed and often failed partway, leaving
// the console restarting its boot over and over, which is a far worse experience than simply
// running slower. So the ladder deliberately starts at 100 kHz and never attempts above it.
//
// This supersedes an earlier note claiming multiboot ran at 200 kHz. That figure came from an
// automatic ladder that kept the first rate to succeed, which meant it reported whichever rung
// it happened to be on when the console finished booting — timing luck, not a measurement.
// Manual per-speed testing with repeats is what settled it.
// TWO RUNGS, NOT FIVE, AND THE PAYLOAD SIZE IS WHY.
//
// The ladder used to run down to 5 kHz. That was harmless when the payload was 5 kB; with a
// 37 kB payload, 5 kHz is nearly two minutes of transfer during which the module looks hung,
// and 25 kHz is twenty seconds. Since 100 kHz is the rate manual testing proved repeatable
// (mbrate.uf2), a failure at 100 kHz is far more likely to be a one-off than evidence that a
// slower rate is needed — so it is better to fail fast and try again than to grind through
// rungs that each take longer than the last.

// THE GAP IS THE POINT, and it applies to EVERY word we send — control words included.

// The GBA slave holds ONE pending transfer and re-arms with a read-modify-write of SIOCNT, so
// a word clocked before it has re-armed is not merely lost, it is CORRUPTED. Measured clean at
// 2000 words/s over 25 passes (linkrate.uf2); 1 kHz sits at half that with 1 ms of latency.
// At 100 kHz SCK a 32-bit word occupies 320 us, leaving ~680 us of slack.
//
// The rock-steady "dropped 2, corrupt 4" that survived a 20x rate range was one out-of-band
// word sent without this gap, destroying the word behind it. Do not special-case anything.
